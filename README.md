# Project 02: Platters & Pantries

Designed by Lea Guerrero, Abeer Naeem, Theo Ward, and Will Qualls

## Our Pitch

So what's for dinner?

Yeah, just chased every last meal you've ever had from your memory, didn't it?  And eating out is so expensive.  Seen those gas prices?  Eating in is just a better idea.  But still, what?  You know you have ingredients in your pantry, so that's a start.  If only you could search for recipes that use ingredients you already have and plan your grocery list around them.

And you can!

The Pleasant Pantry Professionals have designed an intuitive application that will let you search from thousands of delicious recipes and compare those ingredients to a personalized database of your pantry to generate a grocery list that your palate and budget will both appreciate.

**Concept:** An application that searches for a recipe based on the terms provided, stores the recipe, compares its ingredients to a personalized pantry, and generates a grocery list for the user based on the remaining ingredients.  


## User Story

```
AS A user
I WANT to search for a recipe and automatically compare the ingredients to the contents of my pantry
I WANT to add or delete other items from my grocery list and pantry
SO THAT I can generate a grocery list of whichever ingredients I still need to purchase before I can prepare that meal
```


## Walkthrough

Here are the steps to use Platters & Pantries for the first time:

```
REGISTER your user name and password to create a personalized account
SIGN IN using those credentials to navigate to the landing page with your search and pantry sections
EDIT your pantry so the application knows what you have when it retrieves search results in the next step
SEARCH for recipe ideas using a keyword, probably one of the ingredients in your pantry
SELECT and save a recipe from among the results
GENERATE a personalized grocery list based on which ingredients the application sees you don't have in your pantry
SHOP FOR, PREPARE, & ENJOY your meal
UPDATE your pantry after your meal so that it is current on which ingredients you purchased or used up in preparing the meal
```
