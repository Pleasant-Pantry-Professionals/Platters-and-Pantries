# Project 02: Platters & Pantries

Designed by The Pleasant Pantry Professionals: Lea Guerrero, Abeer Naeem, Theo Ward, and Will Qualls

## Our Pitch

What's for dinner?  Yeah, it's just one of those questions that chases every answer from your mind.  Eating out is expensive and gas prices are even worse, so eating in is probably a good idea.  But what?  You know you have a few things in your pantry.  Wouldn't it be great if you could search thousands of delicious recipes based on ingredients you already have and create a convenient grocery list from there?

Now the Platters & Pantries application allows you to just that, and with a personalized updatable pantry for planning future meals!

Your palate and budget will thank you!

**Concept:** An application that lets you stock a personalized pantry, search recipes, and automatically generate a grocery list of missing ingredients.

## User Story

```
AS A user
I WANT to stock a personalized pantry, adding ingredients I already have and removing those I may have used previously
I WANT to search from thousands of recipes and save one I want to prepare
I WANT to automatically compare the list of ingredients to those already in my pantry
SO THAT I can generate a convenient grocery list of just those remaining ingredients
```

## A Sample Walkthrough

Here are the steps you may take as a user when trying our application for the first time:

```
First you're going to register a unique username and password and sign in
Then, from our landing page you're going to stock your pantry with igredients you already have on hand
Then you're going to enter a search term, likely one of the ingredients you're hoping to use
Then you're going to select and save a recipe from among the results
The application will then compare the recipe to the contents of your pantry and generate a grocery list of the remaining missing ingredients
After you've shopped, prepared, and enjoyed your meal, don't forget to update your pantry, adding any new ingredients leftover and removing those you may have used
```
